# Hello,

My name is Deji, a final year student of the Federal University of Technology, Akure.I love to read(on purpose) and I also write code. I would love this opportunity.

## Here are links to my answers to the application questions ðŸ‘‡

### Finance
 - [Here](https://github.com/youthtrouble/fuzzy-sniffle/blob/master/Finance/Finance.md), is a broken down explanation of the BitCoin stock to flow model and why it is not very reliable.

 - [Here](https://github.com/youthtrouble/fuzzy-sniffle/blob/master/Finance/Finance.pdf), I show my workings to the calculation of the Black-Scholes call Price for the Yara Inc. stock.

### Computer Science
 - [Here](https://github.com/youthtrouble/fuzzy-sniffle/blob/master/Computer-Science/Computer-Science.md), I explain why it is a bad idea to use the recursion method rather than the iteration method to calculate the Fibonacci of a number.

 - [Here](https://github.com/youthtrouble/fuzzy-sniffle/blob/master/Computer-Science/proth.go), is a program to determine whether a number(integer) is;
    - A Proth prime.
    - A Proth number but not a Proth prime.
    - Not a Proth number at all.

  #### Steps to test, say for a number 25 (you need to have go installed on your machine).
   - `git clone https://github.com/youthtrouble/fuzzy-sniffle`
   - `go run Computer-Science/proth.go 25`

### Math
